![Interactions](images/Configuration/UISettings/Interactions.png)

* UI Selecting/Deselecting - Disable the user from selecting/deselecting tracks.  This is useful if you are using Launch Actions or Action Shortcuts in the configuration to automatically select tracks.
* UI Editing Annotations - This will prevent the user from being able to enter edit mode and change the annotation.  They still have the capability to set/change Attributes, they just can't change/edit tracks using the standard methods or keyboard shortcuts.

## TopBar

Most of the options are pretty clear.  It turns off and on different buttons in the UI.  NOTE:  If you are the owner of the dataset or an Admin the configuration button will always appear even if turned off.  This is to ensure that you can change the configuration through the UI if you hide the option from standard users.

## ToolBar

The ToolBar is used for editing tracks and changing the visualization of tracks.  The Editing Types and Visible Types are multi-select which allows for customization of the types of annotations that can be edited/created and the visbility of specific types of annotations.  It may not be necessary for the annotator to know about line or polygon types so you can remove them from the menu if not needed.
